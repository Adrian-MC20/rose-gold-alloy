# Rose Gold Alloy Mod
Minecraft 1.21.10 | Fabric | Mojang Mappings  
Mod ID: rosegoldalloy  
Package Root: dev.maleficent.rosegoldalloy

This document outlines the current state of the mod as of v0.4.0 Beta and the broader design plan guiding future development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 0. Implemented Features (v0.4.0 Beta)

This section summarizes what already exists in the mod in terms of gameplay, progression, and design.  
The focus is on experience and intent rather than implementation.

### 0.1 Rose Gold Alloy

• The Rose Gold Ingot serves as the foundation of the mod.  
• It is crafted by combining Copper, Gold and a crystalline catalyst (Amethyst Shard), reinforcing the idea that Rose Gold is a refined, player-made alloy rather than a naturally occurring metal.  
• The resulting material is positioned between Iron and Diamond: more refined and resilient than Iron, but without overshadowing higher tiers.

### 0.2 Rose Gold Block

• Players can compress Rose Gold Ingots into a Rose Gold Block for storage or building.  
• The block reflects the aesthetic of the alloy: warm, polished and visually distinct.  
• It exists primarily for storage, decoration and future expansion into decorative variants.

### 0.3 Rose Gold Equipment

A complete tool set and weapon are now available, forming the core identity of the Rose Gold tier.

• Rose Gold Sword  
– A refined mid-tier weapon with smooth handling, designed to feel more elegant than Iron but not as overpowering as Diamond.  
– Benefits strongly from enchantments, reflecting the alloy’s enhanced magical affinity.

• Rose Gold Pickaxe  
– A durable, reliable tool for mid-game excavation.  
– Intended to bridge the gap between Iron’s early utility and the more advanced tiers that follow.

• Rose Gold Axe, Shovel and Hoe  
– Practical and balanced, offering improved longevity and strong enchantment synergy.  
– Reflect the same design philosophy: slightly elevated performance, high refinement, and a warm metallic identity.

Together, these tools offer a clear, rewarding progression step without disrupting vanilla balance.

### 0.4 Crafting and Progression

• Rose Gold is introduced as a *crafted advancement* rather than something found in the world.  
• Its recipe uses refined metals and amethyst, making it a deliberate upgrade rather than a lucky discovery.  
• Constructing the first ingot naturally leads into the crafting of tools and the Rose Gold Block, forming a clean and intuitive progression loop.  
• Crafting is unlocked gradually as players acquire related materials, mirroring vanilla’s organic recipe discovery flow.

### 0.5 Data-Driven Foundation

• All implemented content is built with a data-first structure, ensuring clean expansion later as armor, trims and decorative blocks are introduced.  
• The mod already has a stable foundation to support future systems, visuals and gameplay layers without needing rewrites.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Core Concept

Rose Gold is envisioned as a crafted alloy that belongs firmly in the mid-game tier of progression.  
It is not mined, not found in chests and not offered by villagers; instead, it is deliberately created by the player.

### 1.1 Alloy Logic

The alloy combines the brightness of gold, the stability of copper and the crystalline influence of amethyst.  
This recipe reinforces Rose Gold’s thematic foundations:  
refined craftsmanship, elegance, magical affinity and purposeful advancement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Materials

### 2.1 Rose Gold Ingot

The Rose Gold Ingot is the essential component behind every item and block in this mod.  
Its identity focuses on being a polished, crafted metal with meaningful utility and character.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Crafting and Progression

### 3.1 Alloy Creation

The Rose Gold Ingot is created through a shaped recipe that symbolically combines the three components:  
Gold for purity, Copper for structure and Amethyst for refinement.

Pattern (rows):  
Row 1: G A  
Row 2: C C

Result: 2 Rose Gold Ingots

### 3.2 Storage and Utility

Players can convert ingots into a Rose Gold Block and vice-versa, mirroring existing metal loops.  
This natural crafting cycle supports tidy storage and paves the way for future decorative uses.

### 3.3 Recipe Unlocking Philosophy

All crafting recipes follow a progression-based unlock structure, inspired by vanilla’s invisible advancement system.  
Players gain access to recipes naturally as they acquire the materials relevant to them, without overwhelming the recipe book all at once.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Equipment

### 4.1 Design Philosophy

Rose Gold equipment embodies the concept of refined craftsmanship.  
It does not overpower Diamond but offers a more enchanting-friendly and durable alternative to Iron.  
Its value lies in its synergy with enchantments and its elegant feel in gameplay.

### 4.2 Tool Set (Current)

The current tool set includes:  
• Sword  
• Pickaxe  
• Axe  
• Shovel  
• Hoe

Each reinforces Rose Gold’s identity: dependable, refined and enchantment-orientated.

### 4.3 Armor Set (Planned)

A full armor set is planned, emphasizing:  
• Protection between Iron and Diamond  
• High enchantability  
• A warm, polished aesthetic that matches the alloy’s theme

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Blocks

Rose Gold will expand into decorative and thematic blocks in future versions.  
The current Rose Gold Block acts both as a storage option and as a stylistic anchor for the material’s look.

Future ideas include plates, tiles, bars or subtle metal variations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Armor Trim Integration (Planned)

Rose Gold is intended to function as a trim material, adding a warm metallic accent to customizable armor.  
The trim color direction aims to reflect Rose Gold’s characteristic blend of copper warmth and gold brightness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. Future Ideas

Long-term exploration may include:  
• Decorative sets (lanterns, frames, bars, carved pieces)  
• Optional tarnish or semi-oxidation visual states  
• Utility or flavor-driven gameplay touches  
• Community-driven expansions

These ideas remain flexible and subject to later evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 8. Development Notes

The mod is built using Minecraft 1.21.10, Fabric Loader 0.18.1 and Mojang official mappings.  
A strong data-driven foundation ensures the mod remains easy to expand in future updates.
